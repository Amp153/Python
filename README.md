# Python
If you're looking for python code to verify my skills this is the repo. If there isn't enough then please contact me and let me know.
Several of the programs are from tutorials I've done a long while ago. I've forgoten where I got them from so I can't credit anyone. I'd upload more but I'm under an NDA until 2022. I can say that I've forced programs to work on Windows (ones that are only designed for Linux), made a bitcoin miner (although it was really bad and not cost effective), made a currency exchange app (I've learned lots from that one), and made a NLP program that converts from one language to another (NDA prevents me from saying more).
